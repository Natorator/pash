# pash
A password shell that hangs on to your password and enters it automatically when prompted. Written in expect. 

Usage: 

# pash bash

Pash will prompt you for your password. Once entered, it will drop you into a bash shell (or whatever command you enetered after 'pash'). Henceforth, any prompt for a password or passphrase will be automatically filled withthe password you entered at the beginning. Exit the shell, and your password will be dutifully forgotten.
